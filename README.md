## Description
In line with the theme of "Make Me Laugh", this game taps on the popular notion of "fake it till you make it" and the contagiousness of laughter to allow players and their friends to have a good laugh. Laughter is part of human nature and has been known to be associated with various health benefits (1,2) - such as stress reducation (3) - and even "simulated" laughter can bring about these benefits. This is especially important given that we live in a stressful, fast-paced country like Singapore (3).

Our game concept, whilst simple, seeks to serve as a platform on which our players can experience the benefits of laughter.

## Game Concept
The game will show words associated with laugher and have the players laught into their microphone. When a number of laugher words is detected by the game, the player gains a point. If the players do not follow the laughter words, they would lose a life. Each round of game has a time limit of 5 minutes and a starts with 5 lives.

Players should repeat the recitation of the laugher words - or laugh - as much as possible to gain a higher score.

Players have the option to have their scores published and top 10 highest scores will be shown on the leaderboard.

## User Data Privacy Considerations
The game makes use of the built in browser microphone to receive inputs but no voice will be saved. Only the name as input by the user is saved onto the database if players choose to submit their scores.
